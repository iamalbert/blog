Starting from Windows11, Microsoft require you to connect to Internet and log-in your Microsoft account during installation.

To bypass that:

1. Make sure the machine is not conncted to Ethernet.

2. Press `Shift` + `F10` and you should see a CMD terminal pops up.

3. Type `oobe\bypassnro` and press Enter.

4. The computer will reboot and restart the installation. This time there would be an "I don't have Internet" option, and we can create a local account instead of log-in to Microsoft.
